            "We are focusing on the relationship between sensory information processing, such as color and brightness, and higher brain functions. In addition, we are focusing on investigating the function of melanopsin ganglion cells, which play an important role in encoding external light signals in the brain. Our goal is to answer the question of how processing in the retina is being conducted, integrated and how it is represented in the brain, by using psychophysical and neurophysiological methods. The retina of our eye contains two types of photoreceptors (cone and rod cells).",
            "It has long been believed that these two photoreceptors are the only ones that allow us to perceive and discriminate between objects. However, a third photoreceptor, the melanopsin cell, has been discovered around 2000. Melanopsin cells have a photoreceptor protein called melanopsin. The discovery of melanopsin cells has led to a fundamental rethinking of non-image and image forming pathways, such as circadian rythm and pupillary light reflex.",
            "Melanopsin cells are thought to play an important role in encoding ambient light in the brain. Signals from melanopsin cells stimulated by ambient light, along with signals from classical photoreceptor cells such as rods and cones, contribute to brain function in non-image and image forming pathways.",
            "Our research group was the first in the world to discover that melanopsin cells contribute to brightness perception. On the other hand, the regulation of circadian rhythm, pupillary light reflex, contrast and brightness perception are only a small part of the functions of melanopsin cells, and it is thought that there may be still other functions as well. For example, they may also affect memory, attention, mood, and migraine headaches."
